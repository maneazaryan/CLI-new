# ü™ü CLI Window Management

This project implements a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** application for managing windows and GUI elements in a grid layout.  
It allows creating windows, adding text, tables, and buttons, and organizing them hierarchically.

## üìå Overview
The application allows you to:
- Create windows with custom dimensions  
- Add text, tables, and buttons at specific positions  
- Manage parent-child relationships between windows  
- Display elements in a structured grid layout  

All operations are performed via simple CLI commands.

- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### üõ†Ô∏è 1. Build and Run the Project 

You can build and run the project in two ways:

**Option 1: Build and run separately**
```bash
make                     # Compiles the project
./bin/main.exe # Runs the program
```
**Option 2: Build and run in a single step**
```bash
make run                  # Compiles (if needed) and runs the CLI
```
### üëÄ 2. Enter Commands
After launching the CLI, interact with the program by typing commands to:
- Create new windows
- Add text, tables, or buttons to existing windows
- Display the contents of windows
- Exit the application when done

---

## üìã Example Commands

When you run the CLI, it will first ask you to create the **initial window** by entering its ID, row count, and column count:

```bash
Command Line Application (CLI)
------------------------------
First window: enter ID, rowCount and colCount
Type Exit to quit
< 1 10 10
```
After the first window is created, you can use the available commands:
```bash
add window <id> <rowCount> <colCount> <pId> <row> <col>
add text   <id> <text> <pId> <row> <col>
add table  <id> <rowCount> <colCount> <pId> <row> <col>
add button <id> <text> <pId> <row> <col>
Show
Exit
```
### üìñ Example Workflow

```bash
< 101 5 5           # First window with ID=101, 5 rows, 5 columns
add_text 201 "Hello" 101 0 0
add_table 301 3 3 101 1 1
add_button 401 "Click Me" 101 2 2
Show
 < 101        # Enter the window ID to display
Exit
```
> üìù Notes:
> - `<pId>` refers to the **parent window ID** where the element will be added.
> - `Show` prompts for a **window ID** and displays that window‚Äôs content in a **grid (matrix) format**.
>   - Empty positions in the grid are shown as `[empty]`.
> - `Exit` quits the CLI.

After entering Show with the window ID, the CLI prints the window contents in a grid format:
```bash
[Text: Hello] [empty] [empty] ...
[empty]       [Table: 3x3] [empty] ...
[empty]       [empty]       [Button: Click Me] ...
```
